    "What's on tap for today:\n",
    "1. **Testing and Continuous Integration.** We will revisit the `Eratosthenes` project from Lab 4, improving upon it by writing tests and seeing how we can automate the testing workflow.\n",
    "2. **MyST/Jupyter Book 2 Intro.** We'll introduce the mechanics of how to build a website using *MyST/Jupyter Book 2* to document and share your computational projects. This intro will be fairly limited in scope today; our primary goal is to give you the technical know-how to get started on the next homework assignment, and we will go into much greater depth next lab session."

We didn't quite get to making the proper `conda` environment and hosting on Binder; however, you all got extensive practice with this in HW 1, so we will be providing a GitHub repository with the final product from the Lab 4 exercises. If you completed the exercises on your own and would like to use that repo, you are of course welcome to do so! In this follow up lab, we are going to be adding some tests to the code.\n",

Please choose the owner of the fork as your own personal GitHub account; if you are concerned that this will clutter up your personal GitHub account, you may choose the course organization as the owner, but please change the name of the repo to `<your GH username>-eratosthenes` so we can distinguish with the original copy."
