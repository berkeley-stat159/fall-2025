    "\n",
    "1. **Forks and Pull Requests**: Suppose instead of working on the same exact remote copy of a repo, you work on a separate *fork* of that repo and wish to merge your changes to the main one. How will you do that?\n",
    "1. **Modularization**: We saw in lecture how nice it can be to abstract code into functions, and possibly even relegate them to separate scripts in our repos to call elsewhere. We'll get some practice with that today.\n",
    "1. **Environments and Binder**: We will practice making `conda` environments that contain all of the necessary packages we need to run code, and export our repositories to Binder to be run by the general public, showing your code is reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the notebook `Erasthostenes.ipynb` (located in this same folder in the `site` repository) there is a non-very well written piece of code for calculating all prime numbers until a certain number. We are going to work with the contents of this notebook and re-organize it so it looks like a decent project: better code, better documentation, and more reproducible. \n",

    "\n",
    "For this example, we are going to make modifications to one of the files in our repository and then recover some of the older versions. Let's work with the `lab3_clone` repos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neither Added nor Committed\n",
    "Edit a text file in your repository, but don't add or commit it. If you'd like to undo it and go back to the previous version stored in git (via commits), use `git restore <filename>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Added but not Committed\n",
    "Edit that same text file, and use `git add <filename>` to add it to the staging area right before you are about to commit. However, before committing you realized you want to undo this change. Use `git restore --staged <filename>` to unstage the changes. The file will remain changed in your working directory, but it will no longer be in the staging area to be committed to the repo (to revert back to the previous version of the file, you must further `git restore <filename>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Committed\n",
    "Edit that same text file, but now add and commit the change with an informative message. Make a second edit, adding and committing this change as well with an informative message. Suppose you want to go back to the version of the file in the first commit that we just did. Run `git slog` to find the commit that has the version of the file you'd like to return to. Note its hash number (7 digits), and then run `git checkout <hash> <filename>`. This will revert that file to the version from that commit. However, the old version of the file is put in the staging area; you'll have to commit it if you'd like to update the commit record of the git repo with this version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commits are snapshots of a repo at various points in time. You can take advantage of this by reverting back to old states of the repo. Try the following commands.\n",

    "#### Pushed to a Remote\n",

    "Suppose you have changes that you've already pushed and you'd like to undo that commit, leaving all later commits intact.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git revert <hash>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create a commit that undoes what the selected commit did only, relative to its parent commit. So, your previous version of the repo will still be in the commit history, which is safe. However, if you committed a change to the repo that edited the change made in your desired commit, there will be a merge conflict, and we resolve it in a similar way. Once it's been resolved, we `git push` to update the remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we'd like to take the whole repo back to a particular commit, but keep the changes in our working directory so that we can edit them. As in the previous section, we can reset the repo to that hash.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset <hash>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we can make any changes we want to those files in the working directory. Then, we can add and commit them when we're ready. However, we cannot just do a standard `git push` as our local repo is now potentially several commits behind the remote. So, we must add the `-f` flag, which stands for force, to our push call.\n",

This is particularly when contributing to software packages, big projects, or just when we want to experiment a little bit having the version control capabilities without adding changes to the main repository. This is where **forks** come into play, and then **pull requests** if we want to merge changes across repositories (or inside the repository too).\n",

    "```{warning}\n",
    "For now, every time you make a change in `sieve.py` and a consequent `import` inside the notebook, you will have to restart the kernel first. This is because once imported, the iPython kernel reads that the script has been already loaded and it doesn't look for differences in the new file. In general, it's a good practice to restart your kernel once the counter starts increasing and after doing significant reorganization changes in the notebook, like we are doing here.\n",

    "There are different ways how you can create a new conda environment. For reproducibility, the best practice is to share an `environment.yml` file that includes all the required packages and then create the environment from it. In order to start with this, we are going to start by creating a fresh environment that then we are going to export and share.\n",

    "5. At this point, you can run code from this environment just from the terminal. Our next step is to make this environment available from the notebook. In order for this to work, first you need to install the `ipykernel` package. You can do this with the following command\n",
