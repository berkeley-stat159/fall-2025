    "  1. **Dotfiles**. In git repositories, there are these hidden files called *dotfiles*. We'll cover what they do and why they are there.\n",

    "  1. **Local practice with git**. In our Week 2 lecture, we learned the fundamentals of git repositories and covered a useful mental model to understand repositories. We will reinforce these concepts by illustrating interaction with a test local git repository.\n",

    "1. Fork the `dotfiles` repository in your personal GitHub account by clicking the `Fork` bottom in the upper right corner in the GitHub website for the repository. \n",
    "2. Clone your fork repository in your home directory in the JupyterHub. There are two important things to keep in mind when cloning the repository i) Clone the repository as a `bare` repository (`git clone --bare`), and ii) Change the name of the local repository folder to `.dotfiles`. You can do these with\n",

    "```\n",

    "Basic git manipulation:\n",
    "1. Create a new folder called `git_test` and move inside that folder. \n",
    "1. Initialize a git repository with `git init`. \n",
    "1. Create a new text file in the folder called `text1.txt`. \n",

    "1. Make changes to the same file and commit those changes. This time, instead of using `git commit -m\"my commit\"` use just `git commit`. This will launch the default git editor from where you can write and save your commit message. *(Note: the default editor is Vi; go to the Text Editors section of Lab 1 for guidance on how to navigate the Vi interface to input a commit message)*\n",
    "1. Change the editor used in git with `git config --global core.editor <editor>`. Repeat the procedure with the different editors listed in Lab 1 (vi, nano, emacs). Which editor do you find easier to use?\n",

    "### 3.2. Solving conflicts in the same file\n",
    "\n",
    "When merging the two branches above, you should have seen that git automatically performed the merge, without needing any human input. This is because the two branches edited different files, so when merging the changes on the two branches, git could just take the sum total of the changes made in each branch. However, if two different branches modify the same file in the same location, git simply can't decide which change should prevail.  At that point, human intervention is necessary to make the decision.  Git will help you by marking the location in the file that has a problem, but it's up to you to resolve the conflict.  Let's see how that works by intentionally creating a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new branch and make some changes to an specific file, let's say `text.txt`. Remember to commit these changes!\n",
    "1. Comeback to the `main` branch and make some more modifications to the same file `text.txt` in the same position where you made changes from the other branch. Commit the changes again.\n",
    "1. Now, if you try to `git merge <newbranch>` now (as we did in the previous section), you will see the next message error\n",
    "```\n",
    "Auto-merging text.txt\n",
    "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in text.txt\n",
    "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. View the contents of `text.txt`, you will see that both changes are overlapped in the same file (you can just see the contents by using `cat text.txt` or opening the file with any text editor). In order to solve the conflict, you need to edit the file manually and decide with changes to keep. Use any text editor (micro, emacs, etc) to edit such file and keep the changes you want.\n",
    "1. Commit your changes and to solve the conflict."
