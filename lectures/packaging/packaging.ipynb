    "## Basic concepts: files, scripts and modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous lecture about modularization, we already discussed the concept of modules and how to import them. A package is a collection of modules that we can now import together and document separately, and it builds on those previous concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap: A Python file, `file.py` is any file whose syntax is valid Python. Its contents can be executed in several different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct execution\n",
    ": We can call at the command line `python file.py` (or equivalently `./file.py` if the file is executable and has its \"shebang\" set to `#!/usr/bin/env python` or similar).  In this scenario, the file is being **executed** and the Python interpreter runs over the entire content of the file, redirecting `print()` calls to standard output/error.\n",
    "\n",
    ": In this case, the Python interpreter sets a the variable `__name__` to the string `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing\n",
    ": If a Python process runs the statement `import file`, and `file.py` is found either in the current directory or in the paths specified in the environment variable `$PYTHONPATH`, then its contents are also executed, but with the the variable `__name__` to the string `\"file\"` (whatever the name of the file happens to be, minus the extension).\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple trick of setting this global variable `__name__` to two different values depending on how the script is executed allows for a simple and elegant way to combine \"executable script\" and \"reusable module\" into a single Python file. In other programming languages, the distinction between building a \"program\" and a \"library\" requires more complex tooling.\n",

With just a few more things in place, we have enough scaffolding to go from simple but real-world cases, to arbitrarily large and complex packages of the size of xarray or pandas.\n",
