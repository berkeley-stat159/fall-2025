    "# Automation and Make\n",
    "\n",
    "As we work in a project, we often encounter certain commands and operations that we end up running multiple times. Many of these operations regards the behaviour of certain programs and corresponds to programs that we execute from the terminal. For example, so far in this course we have dealt with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- File management: creation of files/folders. \n",
    "- Running code from Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that perform certain analysis, reading data and generating outputs. \n",
    "- Creating virtual environment; activate them; install new packages; creating an IPython kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our workflows grow, these operations become more complex and dependent of each other. This is where task automation tools come in. This is a vast space, with hundreds of tools that range from simple and general-purpose ones to highly specialized ones aimed at very specific types of workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in general they all share a basic idea: **how to easily define a set of target tasks that may depend on each other, and a way to easily execute any of them in a reproducible way but avoiding repeating unnecessary work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we're going to focus on the oldest (created in 1976!) and most basic such tool, called [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)).  Make is simple and easy to use, and while it has been in many cases replaced by more modern and more sophisticated tools, it's useful to learn it as it exposes key concepts you'll see in every newer one, in a simple and direct way.
