    "# Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a deeper dive into the details of environments for reproducible computation. For the purposes of this discussion (the term _environment_ has multiple uses), a _conda_ environment is a directory containing a collection of packages you have installed and can use (full documentation is [available here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html)). Environments are accessed by name, and you can switch between environments by _activating_ and _deactivating_ them.\n",
    "\n",
    "An environment can be built by hand, simply by installing packages into it. But by explicitly declaring in a file the packages that make an environment, the concept becomes key to reproducibility.  That file can then be used to re-create the environment with the same list of packages (and potentially the same versions and even the exact same builds) on a different system."

The same happens with libraries: executing code with different version numbers can lead to different result.\n",

The solution to this was Anaconda, which allows to install packages with more complicated dependencies, those that likely depend on other stuff (like C or Fortran code) that scientist need. For example, we need `conda` to install `git` and `pandoc`."
