    "The IPython 'magic' functions are a set of commands, invoked by prepending one or two `%` signs to their name, that live in a namespace separate from your normal Python variables and provide a more command-like interface.  They take flags with `--` and arguments without quotes, parentheses or commas. The motivation behind this system is two-fold:\n",
