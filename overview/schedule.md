# Course Plan

Below is a rough course schedule for the semester, including plans for lecture content, labs, homeworks, and projects. **This is not a contract:** it is a _plan_, and it may change substantially as the semester unfolds. We will update this schedule as necessary.

Note that all lecture videos are posted on the [bCourses "Lectures" playlist for the course](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546508/external_tools/90481) (this link is accessible only to Berkeley personnel).

Not all lectures will have slides associated with them, but for those that do, you can find them all in this [shared google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1u58VESS6yFibuYw7-1v3-ZI5R0pk8h7o). Links to individual weeks are provided below.

## What does a generic week look like?

Below shows a table of what a usual week will look like in this course, including assignment deadlines and course happenings. Note that this will generally be the structure for each week, but there may be some exceptions. When there are exceptions, announcements will be made well in-advance. Note: HW will generally be due biweekly, with peer code reviews due one week after the corresponding HW was due. So, for example, on Thursdays, either a HW or code review will be due, depending on whether a HW or code review was due last week.
