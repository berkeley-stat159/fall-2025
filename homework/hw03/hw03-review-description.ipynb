    "In HW 3, we added some more structure to our LIGO repositories from HW 2, turning our `ligotools` local package into an installable python package, adding tests of its functions, and creating a Makefile to execute useful workflows with single terminal commands. The ultimate goal of all this structure is to make it easier for your colleagues, peers, etc. to use your repos. In this peer review, you will be testing out the various functionalities your peer implemented as part of the HW 3 assignment.\n",
