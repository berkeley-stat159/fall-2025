    "2. Make the change that would fix the issue. Commit it to your fork. If you couldn't find an issue to correct, add a random text file to the repo called `test.txt`, and put some text in it to simulate a change. You can do this directly in GitHub, or you can clone a copy into the DataHub and make changes from there if you wish.\n",
    "3. Navigate to your fork of your peer's repo on GitHub. You should see a button that says 'Contribute'. Click it, and click 'Open pull request'. In the description, type 'Fixes #x' where x is the issue number you noted earlier.\n",
    "4. You're done! Now, your peer will be able to see your pull request in the Pull Requests tab of their repo. If they merge your PR, the issue you mentioned will be automatically closed. *Note: the original repo owners do not have to do this for the purposes of the assignment, but if you'd like to see this functionality in action I'd highly recommend doing it.
