# General HW Info

Homeworks will be announced in Ed Discussion and submitted using GitHub Classroom. The Ed announcement will include a link that you will use to create a 
repository in the [course GitHub site](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-s25). In order to submit your homework, you will need to push your last changes to 
this GitHub repository.

Each homework will also have a peer review assignment associated with it, to be completed after the HW is submitted. Each student will be randomly assigned another student in the class to give feedback to, and you will be added to that student's repository with read permissions only. Peer reviews will be announced on Ed and indexed on both bCourses and this tab of the website. Peer review instructions will be posted here.

We will accept late homework and peer review assignments until 24hrs after the deadline of the homework. However, in those cases a 25% penalty will be applied to the final score. In case of emergency, please reach out to the instructors using Ed Discussion.
