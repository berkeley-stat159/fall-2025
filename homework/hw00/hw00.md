# Homework 0 (not graded)
This homework is intended to help you practice python. If you'd like to work on it, you can clone a local copy from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw00) and complete the exercises in `hw00-python-starters.ipynb`. Please note that for future homeworks, we will be using GitHub classroom, so the workflow for grabbing the assignment will be a bit different. We will cover this later with future homeworks.
